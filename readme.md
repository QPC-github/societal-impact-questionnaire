# Self-review questionnaire: Societal Impact Considerations

> Status: DRAFT / BRAINSTORM

## Introduction

We know lots of things are not used in the way their creators intended them

can't hold spec authors responsible for every future implementation in contexts which may not exist today, however spec authors can takes steps to mitigate against present harms, and are expected to think critcally about the scenarios their technology enables

balance these with the advantages of new web platform features

## Questions to consider

### What kinds of activities do you anticipate your specification becoming a critical part of?

Is this something that may be used by citizens as part of their interactions with governments? Will it be used in workplaces or schools? Is it more applicable to a niche community? Is it something that a person might run on a device they carry with them (like a mobile phone or e-reader) or something that runs on a device in the home (like an internet-enabled fridge)?

In this context, if access to the features in your specification become unavailable, what problems might this cause to end users? What mitigations do you have in place?

### Longievity

Are the features in your specification expected to remain stable and relevant for months, years, or decades? What circumstances would result in a need to deprecate these features? Do you have a strategy for deprecation, replacement or improvement?

### What points of centralisation does your feature bring to the Web Platform?

### What are the power dynamics at play in implementations of your specification?

As a result of these features, explain which parties are granted additional power, and which have power removed, and to what extent. In a worst case scenario, what power imbalances are exacerbated as a result of implementations of your specification? Parties to consider include the User Agent, device and software vendors, site authors, users of the Web Platform, intermediaries.

What structural inequalities may be reinforced by the ecosystem your specification is part of, and which may be reduced?

### What groups of people are excluded from using features of your specification?

What steps have you taken as part of the specification to ensure the features are available to as many people as possible? What additional steps have you taken / are being taken / will need to be taken in the wider ecosystem to improve access and inclusivity of these features?

If certain groups are deliberately excluded from using these features, explain why.

### What effect may features of your specification have on minority groups?

minority / historically disadvantaged groups ... (different in different cultures)

what divides are widened (and what are closed)?

### Can users of the Web Platform choose not to use features of your specification?

What does your specification do from an end-user perspective? What happens if the end-user doesn't want that? How easy is it for someone to opt out of these features? What might they lose? Are end-users able to give meaningful consent to using these features? In what ways can people be coerced into using these features, for example by a malicious party; through the use of manipulative design features; through strong social or cultural expectations, etc.

### To what extent do the features in your specification result in increased power consumption or emissions?

What steps have you taken to increase efficiency, or decrease processing requirements of the devices which will run implementations of your specification? If applicable, how are you reducing data storage needs on clientside devices?

Does your specification add features that will encourage or necessitate web users to update their devices to use them?

Consider also the wider ecosystem which your specification is intended to be part of. Is there anything you can do to mandate or encourage environmentally sustainable practices within this ecosystem, from the perspective of your specification?

(Measuring the carbon footprint of a particular technology can be challenging; what are the main things you would need to think about if you were going to attempt to do so?)

### What other risks do you see in features of your specification being misused?

Think about worst case scenarios. Explain any mitigations you have in place in your specification, and in the wider ecosystem.

### Have you completed the [Security & Privacy Self-review Questionnaire](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/)?
